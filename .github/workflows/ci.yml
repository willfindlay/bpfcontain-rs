    # We need to run on macos-latest since it's the only runner that supports nested
    # virtualization. The actual CI workflow will run on an archlinux VM that we spin up
    # using Vagrant. The reason behind this is that we need bleeding edge kernels to test
    # BPFContain, since it uses the latest eBPF features.
